# LR_Delivery_Time_Prediction
The project is about Linear Regression model building. In this case the project consists of detailed regression of Porter app data. Required files have been uploaded in zip format. It contains 2 file namely (1. LR_Delivery_Time_Estimation_Starter_AmitBothe.ipynb 2. Report_LR_Delivery_Time_Estimation_AmitBothe.pdf) Jupyter notebook contains the Linear Regression model for predicting delivery time for Porter app and pdf contains the report of the analysis.
Data file is also uploaded. 

## Note Student Comment -
All my comments are in the code itself. I have tried to explain the code as much as possible. All my analytical observations are stated after the actual code/graph with ''' symbol and the code is explained with normal '#' comments. I have stored and created new data frames based on various important data milestones to reduce the requirement to run the entire file eveytime I load it. This is to reduce the time taken to run the code.
Note: 
1. As instructed all the subjective questions have been answered in the python notebook. There could be some issue in specific symbols as its difficult to write them in python. Yet I have tried my best to recreate them.
2. Section 4 was optional. So have attempted only few sub sections and not all.

## Assumptions -
I have assumed that the data is clean. I have also assumed that the data is not corrupted and is in the correct format. 
In model building section using statsmodels methodology. In first iteration itself I am getting a good adjusted R2 value ~ 0.82 with p-values < 0.05. If I drop the VIF values which are around 10 the Adj. R2 values falls drastically and within 2 iterations its heading towrds 50-6o %.
Since the objective of the overall exercise is to build a prediction model and not much of interpretation; I have kept the OLS regression to just 1 iteration.
